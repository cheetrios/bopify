Database(s) are maintained as SQLite for clean implementation. The main
ones are organized as follows:

- Sessions (sessions.db)

The sessions DB contains all the sessions that have been created along with
all the associated users that have listened to that session. It also tracks
the associated master node user and meta data regarding the session, i.e.
type of music typically played
